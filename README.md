# rust cryptopals implementation
Rust implementations of [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges.
So far, set 1 and the first two challenges of set 2 are complete.

### directory layout

* `./rust`: A library that implements common functionality needed for challenges. The intention
            is to abstract away all complex data manipulation procedures so that challenge solutions
            convey only the unique and important aspects of the challenges.
* `./challenge`: The challenge solutions.
